  We are not quite sure of any one thing in biology; our knowledge of geology is
  relatively very slight, and the economic laws of society are uncertain to
  every one except some individual who attempts to set them forth; but before
  the world was fashioned the square on the hypotenuse was equal to the sum of
  the squares on the other two sides of a right triangle, and it will be so
  after this world is dead; and the inhabitant of Mars, if one exists, probably
  knows its truth as we know it.
